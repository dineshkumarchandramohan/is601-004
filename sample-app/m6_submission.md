<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I had issue in running the deploy.yml from github-actions</p><br><p>Mistake: I did not create<br>.github folder which holds the deploy.yml and sample-app folder which holds dockerfile,main.py and<br>requirements.txt file under the same root directory</p><br><p>Solution: I fixed it by creating both<br>the .github directory and sample-app directory in the same root directory<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What can you tell me about docker? Describe the various steps needed to get an app ran inside a docker container</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>1.Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications<br>2.With Docker, you<br>can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications<br>3.By taking<br>advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can<br>significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> What is Google Cloud Run? Why do you feel it was chosen for this class?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>1.Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that enables you to run containers<br>that are invocable via requests or events<br>2.Google Cloud protects your data, applications, infrastructure,<br>and customers from fraudulent activity, spam, and abuse with the same infrastructure and<br>security services Google uses<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> What is flask? List a few things you learned about it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>1.Flask is a web framework.This means flask provides you with tools, libraries and<br>technologies that allow you to build a web application<br>2.Flask is part of the<br>categories of the micro-framework. Micro-framework are normally framework with little to no dependencies<br>to external libraries<br><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> What is the difference between a Dockerfile and a Github Action .yml file?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>1.GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows<br>you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline<br>2.You can create workflows that<br>build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull<br>requests to production<br>3.A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands<br>a user could call on the command line to assemble an image<br>4.Using docker<br>build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in<br>succession.<br></p><br></td></tr>
